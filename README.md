# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

Our goal is to take in three data sets, read in the data, clean the data, and finally merge the relevant information into one table while dropping things that are irrelevant. The way this differs from the module is that this was all done in one step through the use of multiple functions. Finally, we took the resulting data and added it to a PostgreSQL database where we could perform additional queries on the data. Below are screenshots to show that the transfer of data to our SQL database was successful. In addition, I was unable to upload the ```ratings.csv``` file even after compressing it since the file was too large (greater than 25Mb).
